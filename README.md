# Semverify

**Semverify** is an in-development tool for semantic version verification of
Rust crates. Specifically, it is intended to aid in ensuring that semver's
requirements are satisfied by releases of a crate, and to programatically
advise whether changes since the last release of a crate require a patch,
major, or minor version bump.
